<h1>Jim Mao</h1>

<p class="left">Hi, my name is Jim Mao. I am currently a freshman at the Tufts University School of 
Engineering pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science. Before entering college, 
I had never taken a course in computer science. But in college, I decided that I wanted to try 
something new, something different from the natural science courses I took in college. After 
taking COMP11 with Professor Sheldon, I realized that computer science is a challenging, but 
rewarding field of study. Small problems can often take hours or even days of thinking. 
However, it is exactly this difficulty that motivates me to want to solve more problems, to 
have that feeling of accomplishment.</p>

<p class="left">Although I am an engineer, I am also an avid learner of the Chinese language. Like computer 
science, the learning of a language is cumulative - every topic and skill is somehow connected 
with the rest. Thus, I really enjoy learning Chinese on a daily basis, because procrastination 
can never lead to success. If freshman and sophomore years of college go as planned, I hope to 
study in China in the fall semester of my junior year with the Tufts-in-China program.</p>

<p class="left">While I have only taken COMP11, I am currently enjoying COMP20. Learning the ins and outs 
of git has been difficult, but I am slowly becoming more comfortable with using the software. 
I look forward to the future topics that this course will have to offer!</p>
