1. All aspects of my work have been implemented correctly:

	- All files are in the jmao01.github.com special repo of my GitHub account.
	- I used git constantly and committed with meaningful messages.
	- README.md (this file) describes my work.
	- I have used two CSS files: desktop.css and ipad2.css. desktop.css is designed for 
	a desktop with a resolution of 1366x768px. ipad2.css is designed for an ipad2 with a
	resolution of 1024x768px.
	- My pages pass the official HTML5 specifications and CSS validations.
	- My files have been correctly named: index.html, resume.html, bio.html
	- My address and telephone number are not listed on my resume.
	- My high school is not listed on my resume.
	- I do not use frames, styling elements, styling attributes, absolute URLs, front-end
	frameworks, or JavaScript.

The desktop and ipad2 layouts are different in the following ways:

	- ipad2 layout does not highlight sections of the resume. This reduces the amount of
	distraction from the text on a smaller screen.
	- ipad2 layout reduces the left-hand margins. This produces a more visually appealing
	text on a smaller screen.
