1. The device I chose to use is the iPad 2, with a screen resolution of 1024x768px. I chose
this device and screen resolution because I do not own a mobile device with access to the 
internet. Therefore, I manually changed my laptop's screen resolution to 1024x768px to mimic
what would appear on an iPad 2 screen. To make sure my screen was at the set screen resolution
and not zoomed in or out, I pressed Ctrl-0. 

The following aspects of my work have been implemented correctly:

	- The word "Dice" is rendered on a manually set screen resolution of 1024x768px. This 
	is made possible by the dice.css CSS sheet.
	- The word "No dice" is rendered on my laptop's recommended screen resolution of 
	1366x768px. This is made possible by the nodice.css CSS sheet.
	- I have implemented the CSS attribute-value pair "display:none" to hide elements of 
	a page.
	- I did not use JavaScript.

2. I did not collaborate or discuss this assignment with anyone else.

3. I spent approximately three hours completing this assignment.
