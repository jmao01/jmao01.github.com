1. All aspects of my work have been correctly implemented:
	- all required items have been drawn on the canvas
	- game parameters have been initialized
	- code is well implemented
	- the code is divided into several functions
	- method is resuable, thought and planning have been done with regard
	  to Part II
	- no JavaScript errors in console
	- no additional stylesheets or HTML files
	- files are in my private repository in a folder named frogger

Part II

3 ADDITIONAL IMPLEMENTATIONS FOR AN "A"
	1. #2 Frogger is animated to dead_frog.png if he gets run over by a vehicle, 
	eaten by an alligator, hits water, or misses home
	2. #4 Level progression is implemented. After jumping 5 frogs home, 
		the level becomes progressively difficult because the vehicles become 
		faster
	3. #6 A random fly incorporated. If the Frogger eats the fly, the player 
	earns 200 extra points.

	- game loads immediately on page load, no refresh needed
	- frogger is moved by up, down, left, right arrow keys
	- vehicles and logs are animated
	- if frogger is hit by a vehicle or hits water, then player loses a life
	- collisions are detected using bounding box method 
	- good variables names, code indentation
	- consistent and constant git commits and pushes with meaningful messages
	- .gitignore in repo
